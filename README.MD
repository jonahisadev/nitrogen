# Nitrogen

A high level language built on [NVM](https://github.com/jonahisadev/nitrogen-vm)

## To Do

* Better variable parsing
    * Context: Only parse as a generic variable
    * Compiler: Decide what kind of variable it is
    * Or something like that
* Native Support (NVM needs work too)
* Math tree parser
